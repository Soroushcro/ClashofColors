# Clash of Colors

Welcome to **Clash of Colors**, a vibrant and dynamic game designed to challenge your calculative mind.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engage in a fast-paced game where you must quickly identify and select the correct colors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enjoy a clean, intuitive design that makes it easy to jump right into the action.
- **Scoring System**: Track your performance with a scoring system that keeps you motivated to improve your skills.

## Rules

The goal of **Clash of Colors** is to maximize your score by strategically locking in high-value blocks. Hereâ€™s how you can play:

1. **Scoring Points**:
   - When you color a block, you also color all its adjacent blocks.
   - Each block you color adds that blocks' score+1 point to your score.

2. **Strategic Moves**:
   - Plan your moves carefully to prevent the AI from coloring the final block and securing all the high-value blocks.
   - Ensure that your colored block is adjacent to an already colored block. You cannot place your block anywhere on the board without this condition. Attempting to do so will only result in a definite loss.

Remember, every move counts! Use strategy and foresight to outmaneuver the AI and achieve the highest score possible.
human player always goes first because that makes the game harder but feel free to change it in the code and try it the other way, to do so you would only have to change currentPlayer in script.js from blue to red.
